# Introduction to SQL

SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases.

Relational Databases (RDBMSs) have a set of instructions or commands that can be run to create databases and tables, modify existing tables, add data to tables, retrieve data from tables and add and modify users and permissions.

## SQL commands

We give names to each of the different categories of these SQL commands:

### Data Definition Language (DDL)

### Data Query Language (DQL)

### Data Manipulation Language (DML)

### Data Control Language (DCL)

### Transaction Control Language (TCL)
