# Introduction to SQL

SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases.

Apart from querying data, the language serves several other purposes, such as creating, modifying, and removing records or rows. It can also be utilized for database management operations, such as creating tables and other objects, defining relationships between them, and setting constraints. Therefore, the language is multi-functional, enabling developers to carry out various data manipulation and management tasks within a database.

Relational Databases (RDBMSs) have a set of instructions or commands that can be run to create databases and tables, modify existing tables, add data to tables, retrieve data from tables and add and modify users and permissions.

## SQL commands

We give names to each of the different categories of these SQL commands:

### Data Definition Language (DDL) 

These SQL commands are used to define the database schema and its structure. They are responsible for creating, altering, and deleting database objects, such as tables, indexes, views, and procedures. Examples of DDL commands include ```CREATE```, ```ALTER```, and ```DROP```.

### Data Manipulation Language (DML)

These SQL commands are used to manipulate the data within the database. They allow you to insert, update, and delete data in tables, views, or any other database object that contains data. Examples of DML commands include ```INSERT```, ```UPDATE```, and ```DELETE```.

### Data Query Language (DQL)

These SQL commands are used to retrieve data from the database. They allow you to search, filter, and sort data in tables, views, or any other database object that contains data. The most common DQL command is ```SELECT```.

### Data Control Language (DCL)

These SQL commands are used to control access to the database. They allow you to grant or revoke privileges to database users or roles, and manage security settings such as user authentication and data encryption. Examples of DCL commands include ```GRANT``` and ```REVOKE```.

### Transaction Control Language (TCL)

These SQL commands are used to manage database transactions. They allow you to commit or rollback transactions, and set savepoints within a transaction. Examples of TCL commands include ```COMMIT```, ```ROLLBACK```, and ```SAVEPOINT```.
