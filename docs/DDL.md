# Data Definition Language (DDL)

In this section, we will cover SQL DDL (Data Definition Language) commands, which are used to create, alter, and drop database objects such as tables, indexes, and constraints. We will go over the following SQL DDL commands:

- CREATE
- ALTER
- DROP

By the end of this section, you will have a good understanding of how to use these commands to manage your database structure effectively. Let's open MySQL Workbench get started!

## CREATE Command

The CREATE command is used to create new database objects such as tables, indexes, and constraints. Instead of creating a database by clicking on "New Schema" using mouse, this time we will use CREATE command in query script.

Follow the steps below and let's

1. Go to the "File" Menu on the left corner of your Workbench and then click on "New Query Tab". This will give us a query text window where we can type our SQL commands and run them using the Execute button: . If a specific command is selected, then only that command is executed. If no commands are selected, all the commands in the query window are run.
   - If you just want to run a single command you can use the Cursor Execute button (insert icon). This button will only run the single command where the keyboard cursor is. The keyboard shortcut for this is CTRL + Enter on Windows or CMD+Enter (âŒ˜+Enter) on Mac.
2. Type **CREATE DATABASE intro_to_sql;** in the query
3. Click Execute icon here.
4. After you execute you should see this message on the bottom:
5. Confirm that you created your new database by refreshing your database list and seeing if your database is listed.

```
CREATE TABLE customers (
   id INT PRIMARY KEY,
   name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
   email VARCHAR(50),
   age INT
);
```

In this example, we are creating a table named "customers" with four columns: "id", "name", "email", and "age". The "id" column is the primary key, and the "name" column is required (NOT NULL).

## ALTER Command

The ALTER command is used to modify the structure of existing database objects such as tables, indexes, and constraints. Here's an example of altering a table using the ALTER command:

```
ALTER TABLE customers ADD address VARCHAR(50);
```

## DROP Command

The DROP command is used to remove existing database objects such as databases, tables, indexes, and constraints. Here's an example of dropping a database using the DROP command:

```
DROP TABLE customers;
```

In this example, we are dropping the "customers" table.

!!! warning

Using the DROP DATABASE command will delete a database, all of it's tables, and all the data inside all of those tables. It is also important to be careful when using the DROP command as it permanently deletes the specified database object.

## Conclusion

We hope this section has been helpful with your learning journey on the CREATE, ALTER, and DROP commands. You can easily create, modify, and delete database objects using these commands to fit your needs.

In the next section, we will cover SQL DML commands, which are used to manipulate data in the database. With these commands, you can retrieve, insert, update, and delete data from your database.

Let's continue learning!
