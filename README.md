# Overview of SQL Introduction Documentation

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to our documentation on SQL Fundamentals. In this documentation, I will guide you through three basic components of SQL:

- Data Definition Language (DDL)
- Data Manipulation Language (DML)
- Data Query Language (DQL)

This document provides a concise introduction to SQL syntax and teaches you how to perform basic database operations using SQL. You'll also get the opportunity to practice running real SQL commands.

## What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used for managing and manipulating data in relational databases.

## How We Collaborated Together

We collaborated on building the documentation structure through weekly in-person meetings and Discord instant messaging. After we agreed on one section, we pushed and merged our code to the GitHub.

## How We Created Our Guide

Our guide was inspired by the practical labs we completed using SQL and MySQL in our COMP-2350 Web Database Technologies course. We recorded common problems and potential errors that users may encounter when completing tasks in SQL.

Our guide provides a clear and concise task flow, and includes a troubleshooting page to help users resolve issues they may encounter.

### Using Markdown

This was the first time we used it to write a comprehensive documentation using Markdown. We applied our knowledge of markdown formatting, acquired from our COMM 2116 Business Communications 2 course, and improved our skills while writing this documentation.

### Using MkDocs Material

We chose to use [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to create this documentation because it is a commonly used tool in the industry and offers an interactive user interface with a clean, neat theme. The flexibility to include admonitions, annotations and code blocks was also a key factor in our decision to use this tool.

### Using Visual Studio Code

We used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to write our documentation files, allowing us to preview and serve our documentation to check styles within the same environment.

## Learning Best Practices For Web Writing

### Audience

We wrote this documentation to serve as a helpful resource for our peers and anyone else who is interested in learning SQL. To ensure accessibility and engagement, we crafted the content using language and terminology that our readers will easily understand.

However, some technical terms are necessary for our users to learn. Therefore, we tried to give a simple explanation in the glossary page.

### Readability

We utilized proper hierarchical headings to organize the information and instructions in our documentation to enhance the readability for our users. We hope this could minimize their efforts on navigating and finding the specific information they need.

We utilized MkDocs' admonitions help us to highlight the information we hope draw users' attention to relevant information:

## Conclusion

The documentation assumes users who have a basic understanding of databases and table structures. It is designed to be accessible to beginners, but also provides a good refresher for those who have some experience with MySQL Workbench. We have provided simple and easy-to-follow examples in this documentation, aiming to create a great resource for beginners.

Hope you find this documentation helpful in your SQL learning journey.
